# LiveSplit Graded Splits
## Splits List Replacement

A LiveSplit Component that displays a list of split times and deltas in relation to a comparison. 
Automatically replaces the segment icon based on that segment's performance, compared to that segment's best. 
Requires LiveSplit 1.7.5.

General Settings:
* Don't override - Turns this feature on/off
* Override current live run - Updates your split icons as you run (when you split, the icon is updated). Your current split icons remain until you split that segment.
* Override personal best - Updates your split icons based on how well your personal best did against that segment's best time. Note that as you run more, and get better splits, your Personal Bests' become worse in comparision.
* Override current live run AND personal best - Updates the split icons for your PB AND updates icons when you split.
* Known issue - Using Best Seg/On Ahead (Gaining), etc. with "Override personal best" causes the PB to not be updated based on those criteria. For now, it's best to just stick to a % comparison if you want to have icons for your PB


Split Settings:
* Icon Image - Uses a local image file when overriding your normal split icon
* Behind Best Seg By % - Use this icon if your segment time is less than the percentage slower your best segment. For example, if your best segment is 100s, and you specify 10%, the icon shows if you split at 110s or faster. 
* Don't Use - Disables this split icon, it will never override the normal split icon
* Show on (Best/Ahead(Gaining)/etc.) - When you split, if the split is your Best Segment, Ahead (Gaining), etc., use this icon instead of the standard split icon. (Known issue - only overrides for the current live run)
